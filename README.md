## Overview

In **Restaurant Reviews Part 1** project, we incrementally convert a static webpage to a web application by taking this design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. We also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Features added
Per project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view), added below features

1. Standard accessibility aspects
2. Responsive web design of pages
3. Ability to load pages offline

## Instructions

1. Download the application from this [link](https://github.com/vjremo/Restaurant-Reviews-Part-1/releases), extract it to local folder. 

2. In the extracted folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to launch application. Click on links/button to navigate through web-pages and explore restaruants !!
